# optionsTDAapi
### Using [Alex Golec's TD Ameritrade API](https://github.com/alexgolec/tda-api) to analyze short term $SPY option flow for September.
#### *A Developer Account with TD Ameritrade is necessary (API token and key are then stored in TDAsecrets file).
*Problems I encountered are documented in docs.txt*

## Goals In This Project
* Use MatplotLib Data Visualization and Pandas Tools to show $SPY option contract's volume and open interest.
* Gain comfortability using and calling on TD Ameritrade's API.
* Write to Excel files from Python

## September options flow for the nearest 5 expiration dates.
#### *Call Options on top row, Put Options on bottom row*
