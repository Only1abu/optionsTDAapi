The following are some issues I had while working on this project.
1. Converting JSON Dump to Dataframe

    My code that originally didn't work: 1a. Indices must be same length error, 1b. dataframe is 1 row X 60 columns.

    1a. #callDf = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Expiry","Strike", 'openInterest','volume'],index=[nearest5expiryList,strikeList])
       #putDf = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Expiry","Strike", 'openInterest','volume'],index=[nearest5expiryList,strikeList])

    1b. callDf = pd.json_normalize(r.json()['callExpDateMap'])
       print(callDf)

2. JSON Dump had many dictionary hierarchies, along with a tricky list after strike key.
SOLUTION: Must have 0 index key after the strike key.

    2a.print(r.json()['putExpDateMap']['2022-08-24:5']['422.0'][0]['openInterest'])

3. Having Multi-level index hierarchy with indices having different lengths.

4. Plotting the data was a bit tricky and I had to overcome problems such as having overlapping subplots,
changing subplot size to fit the data, and having multiple legends on a plot.
